The end goal of my software development project is to program a custom board deploying the t113-s4 SoC from Allwinner. The board will have USB host/device, ethernet (via DP83825IRMQR phy) and possibly wifi via USB dongle, webcam via usb or CSI, touch pannel via DSI. There will also be various peripherals (uart/spi/i2c) related to CNC machine control. On the software side I will want a minimal linux (armbian) on the dual A7 cores of the chip and running either Klipper host or LinuxCNC (no RT related stuff, used in conjunction with Remora), as well as a bare-metal firmware (Klipper or Remora firmware) running on the c906 co-processor. This secondary c906 core should be manageable by the Linux host via RemoteProc and RPMsg.
As a first step, I am trying to unstand the dts system to get a minimal bootable image (just basic uart and sd card with no c906 stuff, no peripherals etc) through armbian.The idea here is to build a custom .dts for my T113-S4 board, in a similar fashion than the sun8i-t113s-mangopi-mq-r-t113.dts for the T113-S3 based magopi mq r, to build with armbian by adding it in userpatches/.
I have some reference from the allwinner SDK:
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GammaKinematics/DTS-files/refs/heads/main/Allwiner%20SDK/evb1.dts
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GammaKinematics/DTS-files/refs/heads/main/Allwiner%20SDK/sun8iw20p1.dtsi
And hereafter are the related files within Armbian/mainline:
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GammaKinematics/DTS-files/refs/heads/main/Armbian-mainline/sun8i-t113s-mangopi-mq-r-t113.dts
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GammaKinematics/DTS-files/refs/heads/main/Armbian-mainline/sun8i-t113s.dtsi
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GammaKinematics/DTS-files/refs/heads/main/Armbian-mainline/sunxi-d1-t113.dtsi
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GammaKinematics/DTS-files/refs/heads/main/Armbian-mainline/sunxi-d1s-t113-mangopi-mq-r.dtsi
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GammaKinematics/DTS-files/refs/heads/main/Armbian-mainline/sunxi-d1s-t113.dtsi
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GammaKinematics/DTS-files/refs/heads/main/Armbian-mainline/mangopi_mq_r_defconfig
Can you check all of these files and make sense of these references? Could you break down to me the key differences between sdk and mainline?

I managed to get my way in adding dts files via the userpatch system and compile armbian with those custom trees, so that's a first step done.
Now I will need to add the C906 co-processor in my tree so I can use it with RemoteProc and RPMsg for my T113-S4 SoC. It doesn't seem trivial, but I have a few references:
- a snippet from the allwiner sdk's .dts introducing this core : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GammaKinematics/DTS-files/refs/heads/main/C906/sdk.dts
- a .dts from armbian/mainline of the D1S, introducing this C906 core: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GammaKinematics/DTS-files/refs/heads/main/C906/sun20i-d1s.dtsi
- Maybe you could find another example within armbian/mainline deploying the remoteproc/rpmsg stuff in a tree?
Could you break down the differences between those 2 and help me draft a .dts to use this c906 with armbian?
